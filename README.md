# wherebnb-frontend

wherebnb is a React-based web application that allows users to search for accommodations based on various criteria such as location (country), price range, number of rooms, etc. Users can explore available listings, view details of each accommodation, and book their desired stay. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Setting up 
1. Clone the repository
   
2. Install dependencies 
```sh
  npm install
```
3. Create an `.env` file in the root directory
```sh
REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
REACT_APP_ACCOMS_URL=http://localhost:8000/accoms
REACT_APP_BOOKINGS_URL=http://localhost:8000/bookings
REACT_APP_ACCOUNTS_URL=http://localhost:8000/accounts
REACT_APP_PROCESS_BOOKING_URL=http://localhost:8000/process-booking
REACT_APP_PAYMENTS_URL=http://localhost:8000/payment
REACT_APP_NOTIFICATIONS_URL=http://localhost:8000/rabbit
REACT_APP_REVIEWS_URL=http://localhost:8000/reviews
REACT_APP_CHECKIN_URL=http://localhost:8000/check-in
``` 

## Running the application
```sh
  npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Default ReactJS read.me (For Reference) 

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
